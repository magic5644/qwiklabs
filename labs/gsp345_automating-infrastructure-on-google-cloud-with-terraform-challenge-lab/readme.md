# [Automating Infrastructure on Google Cloud with Terraform: Challenge Lab](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/3505)

## Challenge scenario
You are a cloud engineer intern for a new startup. For your first project, your new boss has tasked you with creating infrastructure in a quick and efficient manner and generating a mechanism to keep track of it for future reference and changes. You have been directed to use Terraform to complete the project.

For this project, you will use Terraform to create, deploy, and keep track of infrastructure on the startup's preferred provider, Google Cloud. You will also need to import some mismanaged instances into your configuration and fix them.

In this lab, you will use Terraform to import and create multiple VM instances, a VPC network with two subnetworks, and a firewall rule for the VPC to allow connections between the two instances. You will also create a Cloud Storage bucket to host your remote backend.
